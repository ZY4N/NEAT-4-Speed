# NEAT-4-Speed
A data oriented implementation of NEAT including a demo of it playing the mobile game "Flappy Bird".

This implementation is mostly concerned with cache friendly data structures, SIMD and multithreading to fully utilize a modern CPU.
Same goes for the Flappy Bird physics engine.

# Warning
The current implementation still contains bugs and has code-quality issues (mostly related to missing comments and documentation).
This warning will be removed, as soon as I have found time to address these issues.
